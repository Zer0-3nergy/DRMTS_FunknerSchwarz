## DSM_Matlab
Simulink and MATLAB scripts for simulation of the Sigma-Delta modulator and model for HDL code generation <br>

## VHDL / Verilog
Generated code for the decimation filter in VHDL and Verilog. Yes, there are around 40 files for each version, but that's due to how the code was generated. <br>
No TB was generated for now, but this can easily be done at a later point if needed. <br>


## unused
Old or redundant files that are currently not used <br>
