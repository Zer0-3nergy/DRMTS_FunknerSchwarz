# Second-Order Switched-Capacitor Modulator

The ideal circuit is based on a first-order modulator by First Secondname.

The circuit was extended to a second-order modulator by adding a second switched-capacitor integrator stage.

The input signal and clocks of the circuit were adjusted to represent the timing used in Schreier’s MATLAB example **SCMOD2**.

The capacitor sizes have been calculated according to the example calculations given in Schreier’s book.

The circuit can be opened and analyzed in **xschem** and **LTspice**, respectively.
